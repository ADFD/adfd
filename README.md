# ADFD

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ADFD/adfd.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ADFD/adfd)

Tools to export topics/posts from a PhpBB forum and transform them from BBcode to HTML for use in a static website.

# Disclaimer
At the moment this is still very specific to the needs I have in creating the ADFD website, and abysmally doxumented,  but I have in mind that this could be useful for other users of PhpBB forums (e.g. to export the content of a forum into a different format). If you are interested in using this for your own needs and have trouble figuring out how you could use this for yourself just get in touch.
