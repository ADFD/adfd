# TODO

* save a copy of the raw bbcode alongside with the highlighted BBcode (for safekeeping and versioning)
* fix quote styling

## URLS

* Harvest ALL urls (e.g. for link checking)
* Look at bbcode! <URL>...</URL> or <URL=...>...</URL> 
* search for links to adfd.org/wissen and fix them
* search for links to antidepressiva-absetzen.de and fix them
* extract domain and use in autogenerated links (use link extraction in parser for that)
* add external, internal and forum link signifiers

## Example Article

Example article for helpers to refer to.

* All headers should be an anchor link to be able to link directly to subsection
* cool way of displaying where you are like in semantic ui

# Caching

Only if it is painfully slow ...

* compare timestamps / hashes to determine if something changed

# Hyphenation

* hyphenate still screws up links (throw out and use http://mnater.github.io/Hyphenator/mergeAndPack.html instead)
