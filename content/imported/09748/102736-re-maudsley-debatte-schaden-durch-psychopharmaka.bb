Recent research indicates that prescriptions are rising because more people are taking antidepressants for longer; often they become dependent on them and cannot stop.  However there is no good research supporting the safe long-term use of these drugs, and withdrawal support charities report that over 50% of their enquiries now relate to the negative withdrawal effects, which can be debilitating and sometimes lasts for years.

To reduce harm Professor Gøtzsche believes that prescribing practices urgently need to change: ‘As psychotropic drugs are immensely harmful when used long term, they should almost exclusively be used in acute situations and always with a firm plan for tapering off which can be difficult for many patients. We need new guidelines to reflect this. We also need withdrawal clinics all over the country, as many patients have become dependent on psychiatric drugs, including antidepressants, and need help to get off them slowly and safely.’[/quote]
